# HTML
A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code. In order to achieve that it is good to follow the guidelines that are already widely used by web developers.
## Semantic tags
Semantic tags (also known as HTML5 semantic tags) are a set of `HTML` tags introduced in `HTML5` that allow developers to more accurately describe the relationship between HTML elements on a webpage. For example, instead of using `div` tags to group elements we can use `header`, `nav` or `section` tags depending on what specific type of group of elements we are trying to make.
### Why HTML semantics? 
Using semantic tags does not change the appearance of the website in the browser. So why is it important to use semantic tags? Quite simply, semantic tags more accurately describe the content that is on the page. Describing the contents of the page more semantically can have many benefits, such as:

- Making code easier for people to navigate when updating features or fixing bugs.
- Giving your page a higher Search Engine Optimization (SEO) score, which makes your content more visible on search engines.
- Allowing users with special needs to access your website using alternative means such as screen readers, which are devices that read the contents of a webpage aloud to users who have visual impairments.
