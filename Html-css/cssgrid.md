# CSS Grid Layout
Similar to Flexbox, CSS Grid is a layout tool that helps developers arrange HTML elements on the page. Specifically, CSS Grid is useful for laying elements out in a grid with several rows and columns.
## Why is CSS Grid important?
There are use cases where Flexbox or CSS Grid could be used to build the exact same layout and both are perfect for the task. In general, Flexbox and CSS Grid are both useful layout tools to use when developing web pages, with CSS Grid typically being used for the grid-like parts of the design. Therefore, it is very important for a front-end developer to know and use this powerful tool.
