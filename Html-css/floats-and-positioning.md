# Floats and positioning elements
## Floats
HTML elements are usually blocks that stack one below another, so you will find a new block below the previous one, in the order you have them in the HTML file. float is a CSS property that allows you to `float` elements to the right or to the left of other elements in the HTML file. Something that you already know how to do with Flexbox, right?

### Why Float Properties
Even though floats have decreased in usage with the addition of new techniques like Flexbox or CSS Grid, it's worth knowing how to use them. For example, when you have to float an image inside a block of text, the best tool to do it is still a float. Also, there are plenty of CSS codebases that still use floats. When you need to work on existing code based on floats you should be able to do it.

# Position
`position` is a CSS property that allows you to place elements on the page. Similar to float, many position use cases have been taken over by new methods of positioning HTML elements such as Flexbox.
