# What is react?
React is a front-end library introduced by Facebook in 2013 and it has become one of the most popular in the industry. React itself is a simple library but it's part of a huge and complex ecosystem that includes other libraries, frameworks, and tools. On the one hand, React depends on some tools (like Babel and webpack) to transpile its code to regular web standards in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. On the other hand, there are plenty of libraries developed around React, to add features or improve React capabilities in a wide range of areas: routing, state management, server-side rendering, data visualization, styling, mobile development, blogging, testing, etc. There is a React-related library or framework for anything you can imagine, which demonstrates that the adoption of React by the community has been a great success. For these reasons, learning React and its ecosystem is fundamental!
