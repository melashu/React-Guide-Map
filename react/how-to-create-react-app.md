# Create React App
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 [If you didn't install Node download here]((https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.1/node-v18.12.1-x64.msi)) on your machine.

 To create a react project, open either your Git Bash or your vscode termina and run step by step:

 ```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

  ```
